# This is a website for my favorite charcter Dirk Bogarde

Impossible to pin down, Dirk Bogarde played everything from dashing romantic leads in the hugely popular, comically risqué Doctor series to the scheming working class valet in ‘The Servant’. As the conflicted barrister in ‘Victim’, he became the first major British star to play a gay character on screen.
